# Shared Components

This directory is reserved for common code shared between webview components.

## Purpose
- Shared utilities
- Common interfaces and types
- Reusable components
- Shared constants

This directory structure was created during the consolidation of the webview directories from the original separate `webview/` and `editor-webview/` directories into a unified `views/` structure.
