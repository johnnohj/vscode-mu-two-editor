## Test Implementation Details

### **Unit Tests vs Integration Tests**

**Unit Tests (Mock-Based)**:
- ✅ Fast execution (< 1 second total)
- ✅ Isolated component testing
- ✅ Comprehensive error scenario coverage
- ✅ No filesystem dependencies
- ❌ Don't verify real file operations

**Integration Tests (Real Operations)**:
- ✅ **Actual file system operations** using `vscode.workspace.fs.*`
- ✅ **Real VS Code storage** using `context.globalState` and `workspaceState`
- ✅ **Actual editor interactions** with document creation and editing
- ✅ **True workspace management** with real folder creation
- ✅ **End-to-end project workflows** from creation to device sync
- ⚠️ Slower execution (~10-30 seconds)
- ⚠️ Requires temporary file cleanup

### **Real File Operations Verified**

The integration tests actually:
- **Write files** to temporary directories using VS Code APIs
- **Read file contents** and verify data integrity
- **Create workspace folders** with proper VS Code workspace structure
- **Test editor functionality** with real document objects
- **Manage VS Code storage** using actual globalState/workspaceState APIs
- **Handle file watching** and change detection
- **Test project synchronization** between workspace and device folders
- **Verify backup and recovery** with real file operations

### **What Integration Tests Cover That Unit Tests Don't**

1. **Actual File Persistence**: Files are written to disk and read back
2. **VS Code API Integration**: Real calls to `vscode.workspace.fs.*` APIs
3. **Editor Document Management**: Actual VS Code document creation and editing
4. **Storage API Verification**: Real `globalState` and `workspaceState` operations
5. **Workspace Folder Structure**: Physical directory creation and validation
6. **File System Permissions**: Real permission and access error handling
7. **Concurrent File Operations**: Multi-file editing and saving scenarios
8. **Large File Performance**: Real performance testing with substantial files

All tests are currently passing and provide both comprehensive mock-based validation and real-world operational verification for the Mu Two Editor extension.
