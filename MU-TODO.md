## NEW WEBVIEW UI GAMEPLAN

- The main REPL will first initialize with three options: Blinka-Python, WASM-Node CircuitPython, and PyScript [CircuitPython FruitJam OS support in future?].
- The main REPL webview view should run as frontend for headless cli-style processes of the above via postMessage() APIs. The webview view will continue to run a full instance of Xterm.js while WASM-Node CircuitPython, at least, will use xterm headless (I think). Both may make use of the Xterm.js serialize addon.
- The main REPL, ideally and initially, will be the point of contact for: checking/fetching CircuitPython libraries (circup) [opening a dedicated library tree UI view in the Explorer tab area], updating boards definitions, other shell-like functions on behalf of the extension.
- {How far can we push this - can the WASM build handle extension/application logic in concert with VS Code's UI?}
- Open editors must be able to spawn 'connected' REPL windows [uses the splitBelow API to create a webviewPanel] to connect to a board - virtual or physical - that is workspace-aware and can read/execute the editor's contents. The same webviewPanel can add a plotter tab for visual data output. {We're essentially re-implementing the custom editor, but this time we only need to create/manage the webviewPanels; can we use something like micro-repl or circuitpython-repl-js to handle the setup/connection - naturally the extension handles any serialport management and we have our virtual fallback(?)} The plotter tab will likely use the open or createNewPanel.right, or similar
- To tie everything together, the main REPL and the editor+REPL need to be able to coordinate. My vision is that the editor's code can 'import tof from mu_repl' or 'import sensor.tof from mu_repl' so that the editor code can read data sent - in this case as tof distance data - from the main REPL webview. For its part, the main REPL will need a secondary tab to provide a web-based UI for: triggering button presses, sending pins high/low, sending/live adjusting analog pin data or sensor data [sliders with customizable range input entry boxes], providing LED representations [blinking and color reproduction]. The main REPL should be able to import the correct library to use for functionality beyond basic board interaction. {The ultimate would be if we can also mimic the register data/use the CONST data item sometimes found in libraries for our debugging. If we can leverage the higher power of the host machine to shadow the registry values of the microcontroller, and use the WASM-Node build to generate the sensor CONST registers, I think this would be a powerful tool for prototyping/rapid proof-of-concept/debugging. This register feature is the lowest priority, however}
- Main REPL needs always-available commands like: which --runtime, switch -r wasm, help

## WEBVIEW QUESTION

- With proof-of-concept preactRenderToString works, perhaps migrate webviews to SSR

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

- Do we provide a custom shell profile, and should we?
- What is the proper scope for our filesystem provider? Active when extension is active? Only for workspaces?
- There's an extension called AREPL(?) that executes Python code in editor/background. Could our WASM do this? Might that play with/as a debug adapter? (My understanding is traditional debug adapters don't play well with Python code)
- Device twin as source of truth for our extension? Maybe think of device twin as proxy device?
- Need to check branding/code use re: mu2/Mu Two/muTwo
- Centralized device detector?
- Centralized circup functionality? (How are we tracking installed libraries, and should we have a config entry for them?)
- Versioning/updates for our wasm/runtimes?
- 


## CONFIGURATION AND SETTINGS EXPOSURE

- 'CIRCUITPY' drive + user-specified??
- 'code.py', 'main.py', boot.py' files + user-specified??


● Based on the research-specialist agent's analysis, the Mu 2 Editor codebase achieves a 7.5/10 alignment score with the stated design goals and
  architectural principles in EXT-APP-ARCHITECTURE.md.

  Strong Architectural Alignment Areas:

  ✅ Board-Centric Design (9/10)

  - Excellent: The device detection system (src/devices/core/deviceDetector.ts) with 602+ board database
  - Well Implemented: Board-workspace associations and device-specific configurations
  - Good Pattern: BoardManager and device twinning architecture

  ✅ Workspace Organization (8/10)

  - Strong: MuTwoWorkspace with project templates and learn guide integration
  - Good Structure: Workspace validation and configuration management
  - Effective: Project creation workflows and directory organization

  ✅ Manager Pattern Architecture (8/10)

  - Consistent: Well-defined manager classes (BoardManager, WorkspaceManager, etc.)
  - Clear Separation: Good separation of concerns between managers
  - Modular: Each manager handles specific domain responsibilities

  Areas Needing Improvement:

  ⚠️ VS Code Integration (6/10)

  - Gap: Inconsistent use of VS Code APIs vs Node.js modules
  - Issue: File operations mix vscode.workspace.fs.* with Node.js fs
  - Recommendation: Standardize on VS Code APIs for better workspace integration

  ⚠️ Runtime Coordination (6/10)

  - Problem: Multiple runtime managers with overlapping responsibilities
  - Issue: CircuitPython, WASM, and Python runtimes not well coordinated
  - Need: Better unified runtime abstraction layer

  ⚠️ Output/Logging Consistency (7/10)

  - Recently Improved: New unified logger addresses previous fragmentation
  - Still Needed: Full migration of all components to unified logging
  - Good Progress: WASM runtime updated, but more components need conversion

  Priority Recommendations:

  1. Filesystem Standardization: Convert all Node.js fs operations to vscode.workspace.fs.*
  2. Runtime Unification: Create cleaner abstraction between different Python runtimes
  3. Complete Logging Migration: Finish converting all components to unified logger
  4. Language Service Enhancement: Improve CircuitPython-specific language features

  Overall Assessment:

  The codebase demonstrates solid architectural foundations with excellent board-centric design and workspace organization. The manager pattern is
  consistently applied, and the recent work on unified logging and WASM deployment shows good architectural evolution. The main gaps are in
  integration consistency rather than fundamental design flaws.

  Recommendation: Focus on incremental improvements in VS Code API usage and runtime coordination rather than major architectural restructuring.

> Elaborate on Runtime Coordination

● Let me analyze the runtime coordination issues in detail by examining the current runtime architecture.

  ⎿  Done (21 tool uses · 74.3k tokens · 1m 54.8s)                                                                                                   

● Based on the detailed analysis, here's an elaboration on the Runtime Coordination issues in the Mu 2 Editor:

  Current Runtime Coordination Problems

  1. Fragmented Runtime Management 🔴

  The codebase has multiple managers handling similar responsibilities without coordination:

  // THREE different runtime creation paths:
  RuntimeFactory.createRuntime()           // Creates IPythonRuntime instances
  WasmRuntimeManager.initialize()          // Creates WASM execution environment  
  PythonEnvManager.setupEnvironment()      // Manages Python dependencies

  Problem: Each manager maintains separate state, leading to inconsistencies and duplicated logic.

  2. Device-Runtime Binding Complexity 🔴

  Current device-to-runtime assignment is overly complex:

  // RuntimeAwareDeviceManager.selectRuntimeForDevice()
  // 4 different selection priorities with embedded logic:
  // 1. User preference → 2. Auto-detection → 3. Compatibility → 4. Default

  Problem: Runtime selection logic is embedded in device manager, creating tight coupling between device connections and runtime choices.

  3. Overlapping Hardware Abstractions 🟡

  Multiple components create their own hardware abstractions:

  // Each creates separate hardware state:
  RuntimeAwareDeviceManager.createRuntimeAwareHardwareAbstraction()
  WasmRuntimeManager.createExecutionEnvironment()
  ExecutionManager.enableDualExecution()

  Problem: No reuse or coordination between runtime environments, leading to duplicate hardware state management.

  4. Inconsistent Runtime Initialization 🟡

  Runtimes are initialized with different patterns:

  // CircuitPythonRuntime directly creates WasmRuntimeManager
  this._wasmRuntime = new WasmRuntimeManager({...}, this._context);

  // But RuntimeManager creates runtimes through factory
  const runtime = await this.factory.createRuntime('circuitpython');

  Problem: No unified runtime lifecycle management across the codebase.

  Architectural Solution: Unified Runtime Coordination

  Phase 1: Central Runtime Coordinator 🎯

  Create a single coordination layer:

  interface IRuntimeCoordinator {
    // Single registry for all runtimes
    registerRuntime(runtime: IPythonRuntime): void;
    getActiveRuntimes(): Map<PythonRuntimeType, IPythonRuntime>;

    // Intelligent runtime selection
    selectBestRuntime(device: IDevice): Promise<IPythonRuntime>;

    // Unified state management
    switchDeviceRuntime(deviceId: string, newType: PythonRuntimeType): Promise<boolean>;

    // Health monitoring
    monitorRuntimeHealth(): void;
  }

  Phase 2: Separation of Concerns 🎯

  Split responsibilities cleanly:

  1. DeviceConnectionManager: Pure device discovery/connection
  2. RuntimeCoordinator: Runtime lifecycle and selection
  3. ExecutionManager: Code execution regardless of runtime
  4. HardwareAbstractionRegistry: Shared hardware state management

  Phase 3: Runtime-Agnostic Device Management 🎯

  // Device management independent of runtime
  interface IDeviceManager {
    detectDevices(): Promise<IDevice[]>;
    connectToDevice(deviceId: string): Promise<Connection>;
  }

  // Runtime binding as separate concern
  interface IRuntimeBinder {
    bindDeviceToRuntime(deviceId: string, runtime: IPythonRuntime): Promise<void>;
    getDeviceRuntime(deviceId: string): IPythonRuntime | null;
  }

  Specific Benefits of Improved Coordination:

  ✅ Simplified Runtime Switching

  - Switch from CircuitPython WASM to physical device seamlessly
  - No need to recreate device connections when changing runtimes

  ✅ Consistent State Management

  - Single source of truth for runtime status
  - Synchronized hardware state across all runtimes

  ✅ Better Resource Management

  - Shared hardware abstractions reduce memory usage
  - Coordinated runtime lifecycle prevents resource leaks

  ✅ Easier Testing & Debugging

  - Clear interfaces enable better unit testing
  - Centralized coordination simplifies debugging runtime issues

  Priority Implementation Order:

  1. 🔴 High Priority: Create central RuntimeCoordinator to eliminate state conflicts
  2. 🟡 Medium Priority: Separate device connection from runtime selection logic
  3. 🟢 Low Priority: Optimize hardware abstraction sharing and resource management

  This coordination improvement would maintain the current multi-runtime capability while eliminating the complexity and inconsistencies in the
  current architecture.
