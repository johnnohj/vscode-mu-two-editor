## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- (circup) When on 'Global' tab, dedicated library view GUI in the Explorer tab area that:
   - Shows currently-installed libraries (should be the full bundle in global)
   - Shows installed version, bold red if update available
   - has blank input line
   - has 'Install' button - installs/updates that library to global lib

- (circup) When on 'Workspace' tab, dedicated library view GUI in the Explorer tab area that:
   - Shows current project 'code.py' local-disk equivalent path+name
   - Shows currently-installed project libraries
   - Shows installed version, bold red if update available
   - has blank input line
   - has 'Install' button - if version entered in input line, installs/adds that version to active project lib, else installs latest

- (webview REPLs) To tie everything together, the main REPL and the editor+REPL need to be able to coordinate. My vision is that the editor's code can 'import tof from mu_repl' or 'import sensor.tof from mu_repl' so that the editor code can read data sent - in this case as tof distance data - from the main REPL webview. For its part, the main REPL will need a secondary tab to provide a web-based UI for: triggering button presses, sending pins high/low, sending/live adjusting analog pin data or sensor data [sliders with customizable range input entry boxes], providing LED representations [blinking and color reproduction]. The main REPL should be able to import the correct library to use for functionality beyond basic board interaction. {The ultimate would be if we can also mimic the register data/use the CONST data item sometimes found in libraries for our debugging. If we can leverage the higher power of the host machine to shadow the registry values of the microcontroller, and use the WASM-Node build to generate the sensor CONST registers, I think this would be a powerful tool for prototyping/rapid proof-of-concept/debugging. This register feature is the lowest priority, however}
- Main REPL needs always-available commands like: which --runtime, switch -r wasm, help
- '.commands'?, e.g., '.which --runtime', '.switch -r wasm', '.help'?

## WEBVIEW QUESTION

- With proof-of-concept preactRenderToString works, perhaps migrate webviews to SSR

## GENERAL QUESTIONS

- What is the proper scope for our filesystem provider? Active when extension is active? Only for workspaces?
- There's an extension called AREPL(?) that executes Python code in editor/background. Could our WASM do this? Might that play with/as a debug adapter? (My understanding is traditional debug adapters don't play well with Python code)
- Device twin as source of truth for our extension? Maybe think of device twin as proxy device?
- Need to check branding/code use re: mu2/Mu Two/muTwo
- Centralized circup functionality? (How are we tracking installed libraries, and should we have a config entry for them?)
- Versioning/updates for our wasm/runtimes?
- What needs to be implemented/setup during install or immediately afterward? Do we know what the directory structure will be and where to place the resources we'll need?

## CONFIGURATION AND SETTINGS EXPOSURE

- 'CIRCUITPY' drive + user-specified??
- 'code.py', 'main.py', boot.py' files + user-specified??
