# Current Design Concerns & Priority Areas

## Primary UX Concerns

### 1. Workspace Creation & Project Swapping UX
**Current Challenge**: Too many steps, unclear when workspace vs project operations are needed

**User Experience Goals**:
- One-click workflows for 80% of cases (device detected → instant workspace)
- Progressive disclosure (simple choices first, complexity only when needed)
- Context awareness (different flows based on current state)
- Smooth project swapping within existing workspaces

### 2. "Save Twice" Strategy Clarity
**Current Challenge**: Users don't understand when/why double-save happens

**User Experience Goals**:
- Visual save state indicators showing local vs device status
- Clear feedback about what's happening during save process
- Graceful handling when device unavailable
- Educational prompts for first-time users

### 3. Plotter & Debug Activation UX
**Current Challenge**: Unclear when plotter/debug features are available, how to activate them

**User Experience Goals**:
- Contextual feature discovery (show what's available when)
- Auto-activation when requirements are met
- Clear setup guidance when requirements missing
- Smart feature recommendations

### 4. Terminal Profile Strategy & Focus Management
**Current Challenge**: Need to define when main REPL terminal vs contributed VS Code terminal profile makes sense

**Design Questions**:
- When should the extension use its webview terminal vs VS Code's terminal system?
- How should the two interoperate?
- Where does terminal focus belong in different contexts?
- How to handle terminal coordination between multiple approaches?

## Auto-Update & Maintenance Strategy

### 5. Invisible Maintenance System
**User Experience Goals**:
- Keep CircuitPython stubs up to date automatically
- Update board database without user intervention
- Allow CP developers to work with .py versions of libraries
- Have them cross-compile to .mpy files when transferred to devices
- Keep board-centered guides up to date (from Adafruit's GitHub repos)
- Enable workspaces to smoothly retrieve and swap projects

### 6. Library Management & Cross-Compilation
**Current Challenge**: Need seamless .py to .mpy workflow for large libraries

**User Experience Goals**:
- Auto-detect when libraries should be compiled for space savings
- Transparent cross-compilation during file transfer
- Maintain .py versions locally for editing
- Smart library optimization based on target board capabilities
- Version management for library updates

### 7. Board Association Strategy
**Design Decision**: Require board association during workspace creation

**Implementation Strategy**:
- No deferred board selection (eliminated complexity)
- "Any CircuitPython Board" option with virtual device backing
- Smart reconnection prompts when associated board detected
- Smooth virtual-to-physical transition workflow
- Clear visual indicators of association status

## Technical Architecture Concerns

### 8. VS Code Extension Best Practices Gaps
**Performance Issues**:
- Synchronous file operations blocking main thread
- No lazy loading of heavy components
- Inefficient 5-second polling for device detection

**Architecture Issues**:
- Inconsistent error handling across components
- No centralized logging system
- Missing proper disposal patterns leading to memory leaks
- ExtensionContext passed around too much creating tight coupling

### 9. Activation Events & Extension Lifecycle
**Current Problems**:
- Too many activation events causing unnecessary startup
- `onCustomEditor` without proper `when` clauses
- Missing proper workspace detection logic

**Best Practice Fixes Needed**:
- Reduce to essential activation events only
- Add proper `when` clause conditions
- Implement workspace-specific activation logic

### 10. Resource Management & Error Handling
**Current Gaps**:
- Event listeners and disposables not properly cleaned up
- Some classes don't implement proper disposal
- Webviews may not clean up event listeners
- Missing graceful degradation when features fail

**Implementation Needed**:
- Consistent dispose patterns across all classes
- Centralized error handling and logging
- Graceful fallbacks when components fail
- Progress indicators for long operations

## Testing Strategy Concerns

### 11. UX Flow Testing
**Priority Testing Needs**:
- Activation → Workspace Ready flow (first few minutes)
- Existing workspace with device vs new workspace creation
- Board association and reconnection scenarios
- Save twice strategy validation
- Feature activation and availability

**Testing Approaches**:
- User journey simulation for critical flows
- Performance benchmarking for activation times
- UX metrics collection during testing
- Mock device scenarios for reliable testing

### 12. Complex UX Orchestration
**Challenge**: Testing sophisticated UX flows that involve multiple components

**Strategy Needed**:
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Flow validation with realistic user scenarios
- Performance testing for activation sequences
- Error scenario testing (device disconnection, etc.)

## Development Velocity Concerns

### 13. Technical Debt Areas
**Current Gaps**:
- No unit tests making refactoring risky
- No integration tests for component interactions
- No webview testing for UI components
- Missing JSDoc comments making API unclear
- Inconsistent typing with some `any` types

**Implementation Priority**:
1. Implement centralized logging and error handling
2. Add proper disposal patterns
3. Create testing infrastructure
4. Add performance optimizations

### 14. Configuration Management
**Current Issues**:
- No configuration validation before use
- Missing configuration scope definitions
- No migration strategy for config changes
- Settings not properly typed or documented

**Best Practice Implementation Needed**:
- Add configuration validation
- Define proper scopes (application vs workspace)
- Implement configuration migration
- Add comprehensive configuration documentation

## Priority Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: UX Flow Optimization (Week 1-3)
1. **Implement simplified board association** - No deferral, clean choices
2. **Add visual save state indicators** - Clear "save twice" feedback
3. **Create contextual feature discovery** - Smart activation prompts
4. **Optimize activation flow** - Faster startup, better feedback

### Phase 2: Architecture Cleanup (Week 4)
1. **Implement centralized logging** - Better debugging and diagnostics
2. **Add proper disposal patterns** - Fix memory leaks
3. **Refactor activation events** - Reduce unnecessary activations
4. **Add configuration validation** - Prevent invalid settings

### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure (Week 5-6)
1. **Add activation flow testing** - Critical user journey validation
2. **Implement UX flow simulation** - Realistic user behavior testing
3. **Create performance benchmarks** - Prevent regressions
4. **Add integration tests** - Verify component interactions
